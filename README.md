# eospayroll

A simple payroll smart contract developed by Jmacktacular for use on EOSNation.

Work still needs to be done to have the full functionality intended:

-Add deffered trnasaction code so that the contract can execute payments automatically.

-Add a method of grabbing live prices and values from the internet.

-Include more robust error messages and memos.
